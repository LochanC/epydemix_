- Loop through generations
    - Generate new particle
    - Perturb particle
    - Simulate data from perturbed particle
    - Calculate distance between observed and simulated data
    - Check if distance is below tolerance threshold
- Update tolerance threshold for next generation
- Update weights for the next generation
