    "## Understanding the Basics of Epidemiological Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into code, let’s quickly go over the basic structure of an epidemiological compartmental model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compartmental models are used to describe how diseases spread through populations. These models divide the population into compartments, each representing a specific state in the progression of the disease. One of the simplest models is the **SIR model**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **S** represents the susceptible individuals (those who can get infected).\n",
    "- **I** represents the infected individuals (those who are currently carrying the disease).\n",
    "- **R** represents the recovered individuals (those who have recovered and are immune).\n",
    "\n",
    "In compartmental models, individuals move between compartments through transitions, which are of two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mediated Transitions**: These transitions occur due to interactions between individuals in different compartments. In the case of the SIR model, the transition from **S** (susceptible) to **I** (infected) is mediated by the presence of infected individuals. The rate at which susceptibles become infected depends on both the number of infected individuals and the transmission rate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For example, the transition from **S** to **I** happens at a rate proportional to:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Transition rate = β × S × I\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - **β** is the transmission rate,\n",
    "  - **S** is the number of susceptible individuals,\n",
    "  - **I** is the number of infected individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spontaneous Transitions**: These transitions happen independently of interactions with other compartments. For instance, in the SIR model, the transition from **I** (infected) to **R** (recovered) is spontaneous because infected individuals recover based on a fixed recovery rate without needing to interact with any other compartment.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This transition from **I** to **R** occurs at a rate proportional to:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Transition rate = γ × I\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  where:\n",
    "  - **γ** is the recovery rate,\n",
    "  - **I** is the number of infected individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamics of the disease over time are shaped by these transitions, as individuals move between susceptible, infected, and recovered states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's see how we can define a simple SIR model using **epydemix**.\n"
