## Simulation 
- preprocessing function (for custom initial conditions)
- nowprocessing function (for custom operation during the simulation, such as variant introduction)
- custom interaction term calculation 
- rates that are arrays (different for each demographic, such as IFR)
- add ValueError for protected sympy rate names
- parallelization
- add_interventions: would it make sense to distinguish between functions for new_matrix and reduction_factor?
- add_interventions, add the possibility to modulate only the beta, or possibly any parameter
- simulate(): take compute_quantiles out
- think about how to "merge" simulate and stochastic_function, so that we always call simulate and not stochastic_function, also in the calibration. A possiblity can be to add a "prepare_simulation function that is called before every run. Simulate can also go out from EpiModel


## Calibration 
- single calibration function with switch?
- implementation of the simple rejection algorithm 
- model selection, needs to restructure CalibrationResults
- ABC-SMC, model(p) must returns all simulated stuff
- ABC-SMC, allow possiblity to resume runs (?)
- compute_quantiles() may raise error with strange custom output, allow for the possibility to set it to False
- additional functionalities for the top_perc approach: 
    - returns all the runs 
    - select top_perc runs a posteriori
- parallelization also on more simple calibrations
- run projections sampling from the posterior
- add to CalibrationResults the performance of selected trajectories (distribution and average error metric)


## Plotting 
- divide plotting function in submodules, some are only for calibration, other to Population and simulation

## Others
- decide structure of the data package: 
    - how to integrate Prem et al and Mistry et al (also, there are two Prem et al)
    - decide whether to give only one age group aggregation or let the user choose (but note that Mistry and Prem have different age groups)
- complete data package based on these decisions
- submodules divisions

## Population
- add possibility to do the import directly from the init
- make the population object an attribute of EpiModel, with default values


## Transitions
- change the name of attribute rate_name, this is rather an expression
- test transitions mediated by more agents (in the future we can also speed up these cases by factoring out the matrix product)
