## Simulation 
- nowprocessing function (for custom operation during the simulation, such as variant introduction)
- custom interaction term calculation 
- rates that are arrays (different for each demographic, such as IFR)
- parallelization

## Calibration 
- single calibration function with switch?
- implementation of the simple rejection algorithm 
- model selection, needs to restructure CalibrationResults
- compute_quantiles() may raise error with strange custom output, allow for the possibility to set it to False
- additional functionalities for the top_perc approach: 
    - returns all the runs 
    - select top_perc runs a posteriori
- parallelization also on more simple calibrations


## Plotting 
- divide plotting function in submodules, some are only for calibration, other to Population and simulation

## Others
- decide structure of the data package: 
    - how to integrate Prem et al and Mistry et al (also, there are two Prem et al)
    - decide whether to give only one age group aggregation or let the user choose (but note that Mistry and Prem have different age groups)
- complete data package based on these decisions
- submodules divisions

## Population


## Transitions
- test transitions mediated by more agents (in the future we can also speed up these cases by factoring out the matrix product)
