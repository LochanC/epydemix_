## Simulation 
- preprocessing function (for custom initial conditions)
- nowprocessing function (for custom operation during the simulation, such as variant introduction)
- custom interation term calculation 
- rates that are arrays (different for each demographic, such as IFR)
- add ValueError for protected sympy rate names
- give a name to inteventions (related to plotting below)
- add possibility to add daily steps
- parallelization

## Calibration 
- implementation of the simple rejection algorithm 
- implementation of the ABC-SMC algorithm via pyabc integration
- additional functionalities for the top_perc approach: 
    - returns all the runs 
    - select top_perc runs a posteriori
- parallelization also on more simple calibrations

## Plotting 
- plot spectral radius or something related to the interventions

## Others
- decide structure of the data package: 
    - how to integrate Prem et al and Mistry et al (also, there are two Prem et al)
    - decide whether to give only one age group aggregation or let the user choose (but note that Mistry and Prem have different age groups)
- complete data package based on these decisions
